The platform is the God of the meta-universe, living and dying, and those who question are downgraded and banned.</p><p>Like fish on anvil. I don&#39;t like this kind of world, and I want to seek change.</p><p>I want to reconstruct a new Internet: let everyone own their <strong>own data. Let the people&#39;s data belong to the people.</strong></p><p>So, today, I started this project - rmw.link.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="rmw.link\u6807\u8BED\u56FE"></p><h2 id="how-to-build-an-equal-internet-for-everyone" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-build-an-equal-internet-for-everyone" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How to build an equal Internet for everyone ?</h2><p>Today&#39;s Internet is designed based on a client-server architecture.</p><p>The client uploads the content to the server, and the server distributes the data to the viewer.</p><p>In the client-server architecture, there is no equality of power between the two parties.</p><p>The server owns all the data, while the client can only beg permission from the server to make itself visible.</p><p>The root cause of today&#39;s oligarchically-controlled world of the Internet is this illogical architectural design.</p><p>And to change all that, it&#39;s just a simple change of thinking.</p><p>Each person stores the data he or she creates and distributes it to subscribers.</p><p>Subscribers can also distribute data to each other, eliminating the need for servers.</p><p>In this way, data affirmative action is achieved. Each person has his or her own data sovereignty.</p><p>Based on the decentralization of content storage and distribution, a decentralized credit system can be further developed.</p><p>Each person can rent storage and bandwidth, storing idle resources in exchange for another person&#39;s storage bandwidth (called a credit when unused).</p><p>For example, you can encrypt and back up your own files to someone else&#39;s machine.</p><p>Similarly, the storage and bandwidth can be paid to the webmaster of the site as a subscription fee.</p><p>The webmaster, in turn, has a lot of storage and bandwidth because of the subscriptions of his fans, which he can further resell to make money to profit and support his family.</p><p>In my opinion, the many blockchain virtual coins that consume a lot of resources to calculate meaningless hashes can only be a waste of electricity and not environmentally friendly.</p><p>Of course, Bitcoin has its historical significance.</p><p>It was the first time it made the world realize that there are still programs so much more possible, that faith has a price, and that I believe in solid me.</p><p>It was the first time it embedded the financial system into the digital universe, like Prometheus stealing the fire of the heavens to earth.</p><p>Bitcoin is the new beginning, not the end, of the history of human digital civilization.</p><p>I believe that more practical digital equivalents (bandwidth, storage) will rise up and take their place, and build out a whole new system of credit money for the digital world.</p><p>For example, a group of long-term online, long-lasting operation of the credit line of the deposit node, can form a basket currency, as the universal equivalent of the virtual world, called &#39;rmw.link coin&#39;.</p><p>After a certain economy of scale is formed, people can even raise funds for the credit amount and distribute dividends for the credit amount.</p><p>With credit and dividends, we can stimulate the development and growth of the sharing economy, increase the utilization rate of idle resources, and stimulate the initiative of human beings to create value.</p><p>Of course, there will be many difficulties and obstacles in the technical details to achieve all this.</p><p>However, I believe that where there is a will, there is a way.</p><p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.</p><p>Just like Imaho wrote in &quot;The Legend of Goku&quot;.</p><blockquote><p>I want the sky, can no longer cover my eyes.</p><p>To this earth, no longer can bury my heart.</p><p>I want all beings to understand my intention.</p><p>I want all the Buddhas to vanish into thin air!</p></blockquote><p>Just like the famous words of Paul Kerchakin.</p><blockquote><p>The most precious thing for man is life, and life is only once for each person.</p><p>A man&#39;s life should be spent in this way: when he looks back, he will not regret having wasted his time, he will not be ashamed of having done nothing.</p><p>When he dies, he will be able to say, &quot;I have devoted my whole life and all my energy to the most precious cause of all - the struggle for the liberation of all mankind.</p></blockquote><p>Let&#39;s turn the old times upside down together!</p><p><img src="//irmw.gumlet.io/1.jpg" alt=""></p>',40),u={href:"https://rmw.zulipchat.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f=t("Click here to join the zulipchat chat room"),m=t(" (it is recommended to install clients for desktop and cell phones to facilitate real-time communication) "),g=e("sup",{class:"footnote-ref"},[e("a",{href:"#fn1",id:"fnref1"},"[1]")],-1),w=t("."),b=o('<hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>zulipchat is open source and supports data export for future migration to a rmw.link based chat platform. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">\u21A9\uFE0E</a></p></li></ol></section>',2);function y(v,k){const a=h("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),s(l,null,[p,e("p",null,[e("a",u,[f,r(a)]),m,g,w]),b],64)}var x=n(c,[["render",y],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{x as default};
