Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China.</p><p>Maybe computer mathematicians will find V a bit frivolous, but I believe hackers will like this language.</p><p>Thinking is the first thing to do, dare to think, dare to try, maybe this is the difference between art and mathematics. Is a programming language art or mathematics? This is the eternal question.</p><p>I think the biggest advantage of V is that it blurs the boundary between language design and program development.</p><p>It compiles itself, and in three or five seconds, it can be recompiled, and the code is clear.</p><p>The author of V writes in the <a href="https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V code directory structure</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I tried to make the compiler and the vlib code as simple and readable as possible.</p><p>One of the goals of V is to be open to developers with varying levels of compiler development experience. The compiler does not need to be a black box full of magic that only a few people can understand.</p><p>The V compiler is modular and can be used by other applications. It is located at <code>cmd/v/</code> and <code>vlib/v/</code>.</p><p>The most important and useful command when working with the V compiler is <code>v self</code>. It rebuilds the V compiler.</p><p>The structure of the compiler is very simple and has three different steps.</p><p>Parsing/generating AST ( <code>v.parser</code>) =&gt; checking type ( <code>v.checker</code>) =&gt; generating C/JavaScript/machine code ( <code>v.gen</code>)</p></blockquote><p>One might think :</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/318526180/answer/685952638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not counting lexer and parser, the core code is just a few thousand lines. I can only say that the author did a good job of marketing, the official website looks quite like that.</a></p></blockquote><p>But I think that this simplicity is the biggest advantage of V.</p><p>Do not think of V as a traditional bulky programming language, the compiler is an obscure book of heaven.</p><p>Think of it as a web front-end framework, like Vue, with a low barrier to entry, and everyone can participate.</p><p>If you have any problems, you can change it.</p><blockquote><p>Do it yourself, you have enough to eat.</p></blockquote><p>The beautiful new world is not sitting and waiting, it is created by the working people with their hands.</p><p><img src="//irmw.gumlet.io/cEFoDn.jpg" alt=""></p><h2 id="v-self-compile-yourself" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#v-self-compile-yourself" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>v self</code> Compile yourself</h2><p>V can easily compile itself with <code>v self</code>.
